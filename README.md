Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai
Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.

Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.

In this course, you'll learn about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs, and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.

In this course, you'll learn how to use Passport to manage authentication, Pug to create reusable templates for quickly building the front end, and web sockets for real-time communication between the clients and server.
