Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai
Chai is a JavaScript testing library that helps you confirm that your program still behaves the way you expect it to after you make changes to your code.
Using Chai, you can write tests that describe your program's requirements and see if your program meets them.
In this course, you'll learn about assertions, deep equality, truthiness, testing APIs, and other fundamentals for testing JavaScript applications.



Advanced Node and Express
Now it's time to take a deep dive into Node.js and Express.js by building a chat application with a sign-in system
To implement the sign-in system safely, you'll need to learn about authentication. This is the act of verifying the identity of a person or process.
In this course, you'll learn how to use Passport to manage authentication, Pug to create reusable templates for quickly building the front end, and web sockets 
for real-time communication between the clients and the server.



Quality Assurance Projects
Now that you're well versed in both the front end and back end, it's time to apply all the skills and concepts you've learned up to this point. You'll build
5 different web applications, and write tests for each one to make sure they're working and can handle different edge cases.
